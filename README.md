# ComputerVision_with_DeepLearning

This repository holds a few jupyter notebooks I created as part of my self training using Keras and Tensorflow on various dataset.

The notebooks are sorted by dataset sizes: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, etc
Each sub-folder contain notebooks using different CNN models like VGG-10, VGG-16, Inception-1, etc

Feel free to use, and let me know if you have any feedback how to improve on the validation accuracy...
