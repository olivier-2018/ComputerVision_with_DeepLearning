# ComputerVision_with_DeepLearning

This repository holds a few jupyter notebooks I created as part of my self training using Keras and Tensorflow on various dataset sizes.

I have sorted the different notebooks by dataset sizes: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, etc

Ecah sub-folder will contain notebooks using different CV model like VGG-16, Inception-1, etc

Feel free to use, and let me know if you have any feedback how to improve on the validation accuracy...
